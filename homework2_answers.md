Part 1:
git init
git add .
git git push origin master

Part 2:
git pull origin master
git reset
git checkout --
-- means that there are no more options after it
If there is a issue with the code, reverting back allows you to retry on those files

Part 3:
git branch new_branch
git checkout new_branch
To write code that may not work and if so will not mess up the master
